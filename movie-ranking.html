<h2>My top 3 movies of all time </h2>

<h3>Terminator 1</h3>
<p>
    Itâ€™s no wonder that this film spawned a media franchise featuring several sequels, a TV series, comic books, novels and classics. This excellent film is a bonafide staple of the science fiction film genre.

<h3> Terminator 2 </h3>
<p>
    40 years ago, James Cameron directed what would turn out to be his breakthrough in his film career, "The Terminator 2 ", starring Arnold Schwarzenegger as the cyborg assassin himself.
